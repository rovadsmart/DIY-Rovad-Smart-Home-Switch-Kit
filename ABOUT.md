# About the DIY roVad Smart Switch Project

*Build it. Control it. Enjoy it.*

## Project Vision

The DIY roVad Smart Switch Kit started as a personal project to create a unified, upgradable smart home system — hardware and software that can be controlled from a single app, anywhere: at home, at work, in the garden, on a trip, or on vacation.

Unlike existing solutions, this kit allows two-way communication: the device not only receives commands but also sends real-time status back to the user. Each NodeMCU microcontroller is unique — it has its own secure key, and it will only work with the roVad Smart app. Similarly, the app will only communicate with devices that have the matching key. This ensures secure, trusted, and interactive operation, and opens the door to advanced automations.

## Current Version

- 4-channel relay module
- Supports AP Mode (offline) and Wi-Fi Mode (MQTT)
- Relay timers and two-way communication
- Compatible with roVad Smart Android App
- Designed for hobbyists, makers, students, and developers

## Future Plans

- **Upgraded kits:** 6-channel, 8-channel, 16-channel versions
- **App development:** more interactive elements, custom dashboards, automation features
- **New commands:** expanding two-way communication functionality
- **Community-driven improvements:** incorporating user feedback into next versions

This project is based on the principle of **continuous improvement** — like climbing a hill you never fully reach. 
The goal is to create a **flexible, educational, and fun DIY smart home platform**
Every upgrade, new feature, or user suggestion takes the project a little higher.
